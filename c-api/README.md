# Picky FFI

This crate exposes a C-compatible API. Bindings are auto-generated.

## Native library build

Build is as simple as:

```
$ cargo build -p picky-ffi
```

or

```

```

Binary will be generated inside `target` folder located at workspace root.

## C# .NET bindings

C# .NET bindings are located in the `./dotnet/` folder.
[`Diplomat`](https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat) is used to generate most of the code.

Commands for generating the bindings are issued with:

```
