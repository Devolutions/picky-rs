### <!-- 7 -->Build

- Remove lazy_static ([#424](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs/issues/424)) ([d96e761fba](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs/commit/d96e761fbaf7e4061a9488240e3f6426a53cc6b1))

## [[0.5.2](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs/compare/picky-asn1-der-v0.5.1...picky-asn1-der-v0.5.2)] - 2025-01-16

### <!-- 4 -->Bug Fixes

- Symlinks to license files in packages (#339) ([1834c04f39](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs/commit/1834c04f3930fb1bbf040deb6525b166e378b8aa)) 

  Use symlinks instead of copying files to avoid a “dirty” state during
  cargo publish and preserve VCS info. With #337 merged, CI handles
  publishing consistently, so developer environments no longer matter.
