### <!-- 4 -->Bug Fixes

- Symlinks to license files in packages (#339) ([1834c04f39](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs/commit/1834c04f3930fb1bbf040deb6525b166e378b8aa)) 

  Use symlinks instead of copying files to avoid a “dirty” state during
  cargo publish and preserve VCS info. With #337 merged, CI handles
  publishing consistently, so developer environments no longer matter.
